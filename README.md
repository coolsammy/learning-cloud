## Which Cloud Vendor

Picking one or more cloud vendors is a key choice when adopting public cloud services.  The global market trends (shown below) can be seen as a starting point for you.

It is important to further refine your selection based on the following:

- **cloud services needed** - does a potential vendor offer your desired services?
- **cloud services location** - does a potential vendor have your desired services in your geography?
- **community cloud skills** - what is the size of the technical community in your geography for a potential vendor?
